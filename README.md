# Enchant Check

Enchant Check allows you to quick-check your gear or the gear of the player you are currently inspecting: It shows a short report which tells you:

- If all equipped gear is enchanted
- If all sockets have gems
- If there are any empty equipment slots
- If you wear items with very low item-level compared to your average item-level (e.g., Fishing Poles, Cooking Hats, not particularly a problem in Dragonflight, but the functionality is still there)

It does NOT tell you, whether you chose the right enchants, gems, or items. It simply serves as a quick way to tell you where you need to look.
